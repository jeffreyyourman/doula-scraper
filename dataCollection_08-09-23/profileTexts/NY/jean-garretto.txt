Josiane Hoehmann7/22/2010I was a very high risk pregnancy and ended up in a hospital with nurses that were hell bent on me having a c-section. Jean was so supportive and really helped me keep my husband and I focused on what we wanted, which was a vaginal birth. After 27 hours of labor and all the obstacles put out by the nursing staff I delivered my son vaginally. Jean really gave me the support I needed and I will definately be going to her for all of my following births. She really made a very difficult situation better than it would have been. I really don't think I would have been able to avoid the nurses wishes of a c-section without Jean's support. I would definately recommend her to anybody. She was really great !!!
