NyAsia Brown3/29/2023I have known Alexis for a couple years and to say she is a sweetheart is an understatement. She is an amazing human being and with this new journey she is embarking on is just out of this world. She really cares for you from the moment she finds out you are pregnant. Alexis will always check on you no matter the time or place. She will hop jump and skip with no hesitation to make sure nothing goes wrong. She sends uplifting words and make you feel good about yourself. Alexis will send you things that you need to know about the baby and yourself to have a smooth delivery. If I did not have anyone by myside I was very thankful to have her by mine. Alexis is a very calming person and made my labor and delivery as smooth as I wanted. She made me so comfortable in every way. If I could do it all over again I would pick her a million and one times. The appreciation I have for her is beyond just a statement especially with me being the one bringing a baby into this world, she helped me bring life into this world as well and that is something I would never forget. Alexis BE GREAT and don't stop for anyone.
