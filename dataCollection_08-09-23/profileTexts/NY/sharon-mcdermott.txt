Kerry C.1/9/2020Sharon assisted me with the successful natural birth of my second daughter in September 2019.  She collaborated well with my midwife to help me achieve my goal of having a drug free natural water birth. Although, I was not able to have a water birth due to complications during my pregnancy and during delivery, I am very grateful I was able to have a drug free natural delivery. During labor she helped soothe contraction pain by pressing acupressure points in my sacrum which was very effective for me.  She was patient, comforting, and reassuring throughout the entire birthing process.  After my daughter's birth, Sharon treated me to a complementary acupuncture session and a packet of herbs for postpartum healing.  She was also very resourceful with providing me lactation consultant recommendations and information when I struggled to help my daughter nurse exclusively.  I was pleased with Sharon's care and would use her again if I'm blessed with another pregnancy in the future.
