Selene J Clare2/27/2023Monica was excellent !!  Throughout my pregnancy she worked with me via phone, zoom and in person.Monica was super helpful at the end of my pregnancy, the last three weeks.The last three weeks are always the most uncomfortable for me, this was my third pregnancy.  Monica worked with me on remaining calm and taking deep breaths.  Monica did several exercises with me to relax, she gave me wonderful pregnancy massages and strategies to keep the baby moving along.   I highly recommend Monica for any doula program she is considering or her services.  Monica is a natural doula who is so in tune with what is best for the mother and baby.
