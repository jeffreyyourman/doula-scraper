Gabrielle stevens6/23/2021Lynda was my doula for the birth of my first child in January. She is an incredible source of knowledge before, during and after birth. She even helped with breastfeeding, my son latched in the delivery room! She was such a beautiful source of calm throughout my whole delivery, which was exactly what my husband and I needed. Doctors throw so much at you at once and it's great to have someone there to take a breath and explain your options. Because of Lynda, our son came into the world greeted by two very relaxed parents. Six months later we still have a happy, relaxed baby boy! I will 100% be using Lynda again.Â
