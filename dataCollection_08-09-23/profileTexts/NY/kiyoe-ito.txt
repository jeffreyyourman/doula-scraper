Georgia5/10/2020Kiyoe is an amazing doula! She has such a kind heart and warmth that is exactly what I needed during my pregnancy, delivery and postpartum experience. Because the hospital had a 1-visitor limit during the COVID crisis, Kiyoe supported my partner and me virtually and was available at all hours of the day - my water broke at 3:45 am 3 weeks early and she was available to support us by phone and video from the early morning through the evening when I ALONE (again, hospital policy...) in the hospital with my baby and the next day before I was discharged.I had a very positive birth experience during a potentially scary time for childbirth thanks to Kiyoe's coaching, resources and preparation beforehand. I highly recommend her!
