Phoebe S7/24/2023I don't know how I would have gotten through my labor without Caroline.From our first interview, both my husband and I got a good impression of Caroline, and asked her to be our doula based on that good gut feeling. So glad we trusted our gut! Caroline has the perfect balance of professional and informative, while also getting personal and discussing important intimate details. Even though we had a set number of official meetups with her, she was always available for a question or worry and answered my text messages promptly and with great detail. You don't need to be shy discussing any topic with Caroline; she is warm, understanding, non-judgmental, and supportive.When the Big Day came, she met us within the time parameters that she promised. She coached me through breath and movement, stayed right by my side through contractions, and helped my husband find his role. I felt empowered during my contractions because of her guidance. When I couldn't move after my epidural, Caroline helped me find positions to make me more comfortable and ease my labor. After a while, though, my labor stalled and things strayed VERY far from the birth plan that Caroline and I had created together. When the time came to make big decisions, and I froze in fear and sadness, she was the comfort I needed. She made me feel like a good mom, where before I just felt scared.I know I can always turn to Caroline with questions; I recommend her doula services to any future parent. Whether you feel very prepared or not prepared at all, Caroline will meet you where you are with knowledge and great compassion.


Joanna Kennedy7/21/2023We worked with Caroline for the birth of our first baby and from the moment we met her, she filled us with a sense of ease, calm, and confidence. Caroline went above and beyond with her energy, enthusiasm and time. In our pre-birth meeting, she gave us as much information as possible, answered all of our questions, got my nervous and silent husband involved, and helped us create a personalized birth plan. She was available over the phone to answer any questions in the lead up to the birth, which gave me peace of mind as I was nervously awaiting the start of labor. Once my labor began, she was an invaluable resource. I labored at home for about 18 hours and the only thing I would change would be calling her sooner. When she arrived at our home (around 2am) I was feeling overwhelmed by the contractions, and Caroline's hands-on guidance completely changed the tone of the experience. She helped me relax into the contractions and made me and my partner feel safe and calm. When we eventually went to the hospital and got the epidural, she continued to be very active and present with me, changing my positioning every 30 minutes which supported the progression of my labor. Caroline continued throughout the next 12 hours to tend to my every need which also gave my partner the time to sleep since we had labored through the entire previous night, and helped me remain calm. Once it came time to push, Caroline worked in sync with the midwives of the hospital and seamlessly integrated with the coaching, hands-on guidance and physical and emotional support needed to help me bring my baby into the world. I personally wanted a lot of hands-on and physical support, but Caroline kept checking in throughout the entire process to make sure she was serving my needs, respecting my boundaries, and honoring both my physical and verbal preferences. Her support was a key feature of my beautiful and calm birth. I have already recommended her to all my pregnant friends! We love Caroline!


Jillianne Malabed7/6/2023Working with Caroline was an incredible experience that made a world of difference during my pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum journey. From our very first meeting, Caroline showed exceptional professionalism, compassion, and knowledge. She took the time to understand my unique needs, concerns, and birth preferences, and provided unwavering support every step of the way.During labor, Caroline was a calming presence who helped me stay focused and encouraged me through each contraction. Her extensive knowledge of comfort measures, breathing techniques, and positioning provided immense relief and helped me manage pain effectively. She also effectively communicated with the medical team, ensuring my wishes were respected and that I felt empowered in my birthing decisions.In the postpartum period, Caroline continued to be a pillar of support. She offered guidance on breastfeeding, newborn care, and helped me navigate the emotional adjustments of early motherhood. Her non-judgmental and nurturing approach created a safe space where I could openly express my concerns and receive the support I needed.Not only was Caroline a source of practical assistance, but she also provided emotional support and reassurance throughout the entire journey. Her presence made me feel empowered, confident, and cared for. I truly believe that my positive birth experience and smooth transition into motherhood were greatly influenced by Caroline's expertise and genuine dedication.I wholeheartedly recommend Caroline's to any expectant parent seeking a skilled and compassionate doula. Her unwavering support, knowledge, and genuine care will undoubtedly enhance your journey, helping you create beautiful and empowering memories.


Andi4/11/2023Caroline is amazing!  She was both our birth and postpartum doula and made these first few weeks way more seamless than expected.  We hired her later than we planned to get a doula, and she helped ease my anxieties during my last trimester.  She explained what the delivery process in the hospital would be like, which was exactly what I needed. Durin my labor, she was such a calming presence and helped support my husband and I when we got nervous.  I knew I wanted an epidural all along and I never felt judged by Caroline for wanting that.  When we brought baby girl home, Caroline was our postpartum doula for the first few weeks.  It was comforting that I already knew her, and she never made me feel silly when I didn't know obvious newborn things.  She cooked for us and made sure our home wasn't chaotic.  I don't know what I would have done without her help because we don't have family near us.  Caroline was the caring aunt-type that I didn't know I needed and is a wealth of baby knowledge.  


Galina Kurlat1/12/2023I was initially hesitant about a postpartum doula, but with both our parents unable to join us after birth I decided it’s the right direction for us. Caroline was exactly the person we needed, warm and kind with an extensive knowledge of baby care. I am so glad she was with us the first month back from the hospital, we learned something new each day.


Maryna10/14/2022Caroline was very flexible, helpful with resources, responsive and understanding. She was our doula both for birth and during postpartum. She was helping me during contractions, at that moment I felt that it was good to have her support as well as when she was calling nurses and getting me tea. During Postpartum Caroline supported me mentally and assisted in other ways. I like that Caroline has a good sense and flexibility and is willing to help with whatever you need specifically. 


Heather10/11/2022Caroline supported me and my family after the birth of our second child, beginning with us when the baby was one week old. I am so happy that I decided to call on a post-partum doula, because Caroline turned out to be fantastic. She helped around the house without being asked and she bonded quickly with our two year old, who was adjusting to the arrival of the new baby. When she suggested something for my self-care or mental health, every time it was something that I found to be calming and restorative. She is knowledable about a wide range of issues that can crop up after a birth, so I felt secure in seeking her advice. I was able to get some stretches of real sleep while she was there, and I could nourish myself how I liked, without having to eat at the table with others if I didn't feel like it or clean up afterward. I could feel Caroline's genuine respect for the journey into parenthood the entire time she was with us. I am grateful for her time with us and anyone would be fortunate to have her support. 


Petra9/26/2022If you’re looking for THE PERFECT doula Caroline is your person!We met few months prior to my due date and from our first meeting it was clear that Caroline was the perfect match! She made me feel so comfortable and so heard and supported through out the rest of my pregnancy it was so amazing. Caroline regularly checked in via email and text messages, we met couple of times prior to day D just to go over my birth plan and such. We encountered few complications towards the end of my pregnancy and I couldn’t ask for a better support than what Caroline gave me. When it came to day D I truly believe Caroline is the only reason why my labor went to smooth and fast. I was induced due to cholestasis and I can’t tell you how much contractions sucked on pitocin and especially after my water broke. Caroline helped me ease the pain so much with her massaging techniques, massaging balls and the use of medicine ball that she brought with her to the hospital it was truly an incredible experience.Caroline is super profesional, respectful, always on top of everything, organized, great advocate of your needs and wishes in the hospital, great listener and amazing support person. Both me and my husband would do it all over again just to experience labor with Caroline again!


Lindsay Somerstein9/23/2022My husband and I are so thankful we found Caroline to help us with our journey into parenthood. Caroline provided doula services for both labor & delivery as well as postpartum care. During the antepartum period, Caroline talked us through the labor & delivery process and assisted in making our personalized birthplan. Then, when I unexpectedly was induced at 38 weeks, Caroline showed up and helped ease my worries by providing emotional support as well as calming strategies and breathing techniques. Her assistance and encouragement throughout the whole labor and delivery process exceeded our expectations. She helped manage my care and worked with my medical team to ensure a smooth delivery. Caroline also provided postpartum care giving us some time to rest and relax knowing our baby was in good hands! Once again, my husband and I are grateful Caroline was part of our team and she will surely be a great addition to yours as well :)


Hannah9/14/2022Caroline helped my husband & I with prenatal planning and what to expect in the hospital. We came to her wanting help with a birth plan and what to expect at the hospital. She gave us clarity with what to expect during labor and helped me decide what to pack in my hospital bag. She also gave me exercises to use on my birth ball and helped my husband with hands on techniques to use in labor during contractions. Those helped so much! We wanted privacy in the hospital, so we decided not to use a doula. But Caroline really helped us know what to expect and it was very useful during my labor. She also gave me an idea of what to expect postpartum along with self-care ideas that I used the first few weeks after my baby was born. Overall, my experience with Caroline was great and helped calmed my nerves during my pregnancy and labor. She's professional but also down to earth and caring, so I felt I could ask her anything.


Rebekka9/13/2022I first met Caroline the morning after my baby girl came home from the hospital. I was anxious and exhausted, and Caroline came in like a breath of fresh air. She fit in seamlessly without judgment and brough a sense of calm and light into our home.Caroline always asked what I needed help with on any given day,  and was able to make me feel comfortable telling her what I really needed help with most. In addition to caring for my newborn so I could rest and shower, she also jumped right in to entertain my energetic 2.5 year old boy, as well as assisting with dishes and other house work in the kitchen and bathroom.Caroline is alson incredibly professional. She is reliable and timely and communicative… And really focuses on YOU as the mom. I am incredibly grateful for the time that I got to work with Caroline, and I highly recommend her to anybody having a baby soon or within young newborn. She is a genuine good person and I would gladly work with her again in the future if I ever have more children.
