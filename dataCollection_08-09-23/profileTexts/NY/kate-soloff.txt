Braden10/14/2022Kate was an absolute godsend, both as a birth doula, and as a post-partum doula for our second daughter. A truly incredible and brilliant person, we couldn't have been happier or more satisfied with our decision to hire and entrust her with our growing family. She put my wife at ease, was super-responsive, is incredible with babies/kids, and frankly is just a true gem of a human. During the birth, she came to our place for some early labor and then got us to the hospital, helping to navigate all the administrative stuff and get my wife as comfortable as possible. She knew our birth plan inside out and advocated for my wife's preferences regarding possible interventions w medical staff. She had a wonderful bag of tricks w massagers, electrolyte drinks, etc, to help my wife during the labor process. Following the successful birth of our daughter, we were so lucky to have Kate come and help us 2 x a week for the first few crazy weeks as a post-partum doula. This was simply invaluable, and Kate helped ensure feeding was all good, assisted with early baths, entertained our wild 4 year old when needed, did some loads of laundry/dishes, and cooked some incredible, nourishing family style meals (w ample leftovers) that we still think of fondly. She was a calming, supportive, and uplifting presence in our home during some of the most important weeks of our lives. We will always be thankful. She has a true gift as a doula, her her ASAP.
