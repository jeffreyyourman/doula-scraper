Nicol Gohl12/31/2022There are few words that will justify Erica's excellence as a doula. She was everything and more than we needed during delivery and she exceeded all our expectations of a doula. One of the biggest things was how hands on Erica was and she could read exactly when she was needed and when not. We had 2 very helpful prepartum sessions where she went through my birth plan with me, our wishes during birth, best and worst cases and how we could manage them. She also covered breastfeeding, positions for labour that my husband could help with and got a general idea of us as people and built a rapport with us. I would highly recommend Erica and I hope she will be available for any future babies that we may have.   


Gabriela Pastor6/9/2021My experience with Erica was absolutely wonderful. She took the time to answer all of my questions with detail and patience. She always answered my phone calls and messages in a timely manner. I can't say how grateful we are to have her with us throughout this lovely experience. Erica, thank you for everything!Gabriela
