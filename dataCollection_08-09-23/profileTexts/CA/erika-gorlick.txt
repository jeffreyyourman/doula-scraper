Melissa Monte2/28/2021I hired Erika for my birth and OMG I am so glad I did. She completely changed the experience of my birth. I ended up having a very long drawn out birth starting with around 34 hours the natural route and transferring to a hospital. Throughout the process, if it weren't for Erika, I probably would have been frustrated and even more emotional than I was. She had multiple ways of soothing me during intense contractions. She communicated well with me when I felt other people weren't. She was by my side when my husband was sleeping. She even drove to the hospital at 3 am to pick up my placenta when I finally did give birth. The value of her services is way above what she charges. She takes amazing photos. She made an art print of my placenta. She even wrote "Love" with my umbilical cord and dried it. She also took care of my placenta encapsulation. And if that's not enough, she made me several meals and brought them over during my recovery. Hiring Erika was the best decision I could've made, especially being a first time mom. She wasn't just my doula, she became my friend.
