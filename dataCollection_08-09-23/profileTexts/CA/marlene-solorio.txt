Lucy5/31/2023Ive had three kids and with my last decided to hire Marlene as my doula. I wish I had her for all three. If you're on the fence its money well spent and id hire her again! She was with me through the hardest parts of my labor as such a peaceful supportive presence who gave me the courage and strength I needed to have the birth I dreamed of. No task was too much for her and she had the sweetest attitude through it all. She stayed up with me all night as someone to lean on emotionally AND physically lol. I was hesistant on if hiring a doula would be worth it and MARLENE is worth it AND more. She will forever be apart of this precious memory of the birth of my son. thankyou Marlene! You rock at what you do!
