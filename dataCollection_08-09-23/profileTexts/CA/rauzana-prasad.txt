Loriza Shayaz12/1/2018I received my doula Rauzana Prasad through east bay doula and I was more then just pleased with the services she provided! It was an awesome and beautiful experience to have such an amazing and wonderful person assist me in such a time! She came as a doula but instantly made us feel as if she was apart of the family and having your newborn being handled by a stranger is worrying already but not with her! She is very punctual, trustworthy, kind and caring and I wouldn’t have chosen any other doula for my baby. She is our lifelong doula if we can have the opportunity to have her. If you’re looking for somebody with high level of experience, a calm and collective nature with many many source of experience then this doula is definitely the one! She uses Her own life experience and helps you learn new techniques to handle and care for your newborn. Thank you for giving us the oppee to work with you. We were truly blessed to have you with us.
