Pakeeza Azizpor6/7/2023I first found Nicole while I was searching for a Doula for the birth of my first child. At the time I had no idea about the birthing process and I wasn't sure a Doula would help me in my laboring process. When I met Nicole and saw the Doula services she offered I was very happy to have her in my birthing process. Nicole had several pre-natal appointments with me and we created a birth plan. She also taught me about pain management tips, breathing techniques, and birthing positions to use during labor. She got my partner involved and she was so helpful in getting him prepared for the big day. All of her information was extremely helpful and she educated my partner which made him and I feel so much prepared for the big day. When I went into labor, Nicole came to the hospital and helped me during my labour process. She helped me achieve the best birthing experience, better than I even imagined! I had an amazing birthing experience and I was grateful to have Nicole there throughout the process. I was able to labor naturally most of the time and I really had an understanding of what my body was feeling and Nicole helped me through my contractions. She also came to my home for a post-natal visit and was able to help me with any questions I had. She is a wonderful, compassionate, and knowlegable Doula and I couldn't be happier with her services. Nicole was also affordable and she provided amazing Doula services that fit my needs and budget. I am very happy with my experience with Nicole, 10/10 would recommend her as a Doula for your pregnancy journey.Â
