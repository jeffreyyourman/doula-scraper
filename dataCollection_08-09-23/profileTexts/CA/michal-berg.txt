Ashley Campbell2/9/2023Michal was extremely amazing! She was very hands on from the beginning. She asked the important questions when I wasn't not sure of certain things at the hospital. I was able to take a break from induction to eat and take a nap because of her which was a big help during labor. My doctor loves her. If I have another baby I will definitely have Michal around.Â
