Sharisa9/29/2021I highly recommend Chelsy as a doula. She provided post-partum doula services after I had my third baby, and she was an incredible help to me and my family. Her calm presence and expertise with babies and children made allowed me to feel confident that my little ones would be taken care of while I got some much-needed rest. She went above and beyond to make sure that we were all taken care of under her watch. She is experienced, confident, and compassionate.
