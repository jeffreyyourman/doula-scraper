Kirin Comfort7/31/2023My husband and I loved working with Priscilla. We loved that she had a la carte services where you can build you own unique package for services that we thought would be the most useful. Priscilla was very knowledgeable and was very forthcoming with any information that we needed to know in preparation for our little one. We would definitely recommend Priscilla to anyone in our network expecting a baby or just needing babycare tips and tricks. 


Jennifer5/31/2023I couldn't have done it without Priscilla. She was truly an amazing support in every way durning my delivery. I remember telling myself I couldn't do it and she made sure I could ! I enjoyed my prenatal sessions with her . Getting to know each other and discusss my expectations for my delivery. I felt confident knowing I had her by my side guiding me. As a first time mom I did not know I was capable of enduring the pain that I went through but with the breathing techniques that Priscilla assisted me with I was able to keep on going.  She was the best support I had ( alongside with my partner ). Both my partner and I are forever thankful for Priscilla. Thank you for being the best Doula !
