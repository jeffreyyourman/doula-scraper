Deborah Wahnich- Reitman7/29/2023Katelyn is amazing. She was there with me all through my induction and delivery. Things didn't go as planned for me and I had to have a c- section. Katlyn stayed calm and explained everything every step of the way. I appreciated having her there more then any of the nurses. I would fully recommend Katelyn to anyone looking for a great doula. She is amazing and will make sure to advocate and be there with you every step of the way.Â
