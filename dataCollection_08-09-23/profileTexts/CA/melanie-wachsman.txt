CONTACT MELANIE VIEW MELANIE'S AVAILABILITY

Helen McElwain4/30/2013Melanie Wachsman was hugely supportive throughout the final months of my pregnancy, through labor and childbirth, and in follow up care and lactation support. She provided home visits, with educational support and childbirth preparation, and was available to answer questions at any time. When I went into labor, I was able to contact her in the middle of the night to guide me through. She met us at the hospital and stayed with us, advocating on our behalf and providing physical and emotional support through the birth. She stayed at the hospital until she was certain we were all stable. Finally, Melanie provided much needed emotional and physical support in the weeks and months after the birth, specifically as a lactation consultant, but answering many other questions as well. I would absolutely want to work with Melanie again if I have another child.
