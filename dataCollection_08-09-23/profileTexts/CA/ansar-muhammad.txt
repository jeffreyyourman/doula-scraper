Desirae Kennett6/8/2022I am so appreciative of how Ansar was able to connect and help me through my labor, and in some time of help after!We met for the first time over the phone in the last days before going into labor and instantly she was so warm and accepting. During COVID and not having my partner available at the time, Ansar was there to meet me in person at the same moment I was going into labor. Not the ideal moment for either of us to just be meeting, but there was only loving acceptance through every moment of Ansar staying by my side.Through asking about me, giving advice and being creative with her knowledge base and putting it to use; Ansar embraced every step of the way! She made me feel safe and okay in a time I was worried I couldn't and felt so alone.After labor, I didn't know what to expect coming home with a new baby to an already large family.. but there was Ansar ready and willing to help me figure it out!Because of Ansar being there on a truly last minute notice, while continuing to be so helpful and compassionate to the situation; it has made the moments of my daughter's birth a happy sharable experience!! I only hope so many others can have such a wholesome experience with Ansar as I did.To the best Doula ever!
