Lauren Taylor-Sharaf3/8/2021I am so grateful to have had Becca as a virtual doula for the birth of my first child. During this experience, she offered a warm presence and calming words, along with a considerate and supportive approach. I felt completely supported in my birth plan and I appreciated her wealth of knowledge while going through the birthing process. She is very passionate about birth work and about facilitating a positive environment and overall experience for all birthing people and their partners. I’m thrilled that she will continue to offer her services to many more families to come!
