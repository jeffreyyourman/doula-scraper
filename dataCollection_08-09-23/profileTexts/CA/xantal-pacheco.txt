Emily K7/8/2023We had a fantastic night doula experience with Xantal. She helped us 4 nights a week, watching the baby all night, preparing breastfeeding snacks for mom, doing any light housework that was available. As new and nervous parents, we loved her calm and caring presence. She has an obvious passion for babies and showed our little one incredible attention, care and love. In addition I really enjoyed talking with her while nursing. I hadn’t realized how much this would matter but you will spend a lot of time with your night doula!We’d highly recommend Xantal to new parents and truly appreciated her support in the first weeks of our baby’s life!
