Alexis11/9/2022Bethany was so incredible to have be apart of our birth experience. She educated me throughout my pregnancy about birth, postpartum, and helped me create a birth plan. She labored with me at home and that was really helpful to have the extra support along with my husband. She was there for the birth of my son and truly I'll never forget how supportive she was. Bethany helped me through emotionally after the birth working through some anxiety. She was a huge part of our story!!


Carly11/6/2022I had the pleasure of working with Bethany for my first birth. I love learning and preparing and Bethany was a wealth of information and wisdom for everything pre and postnatal along with labor and delivery! I went into birth with no fears or unanswered questions. My birth experience was met with true medical emergencies and Bethany was a source of peace and comfort. Bethany walked along side me as I grieved not having the birth experience I had planned and helped me to celebrate the ways in which my body safely carried my baby earth side. I am now expecting again and the moment I got a positive pregnancy test I messaged Bethany to hire her once again to be my encourager, educator, confidant, and in turn, friend, throughout this next pregnancy and post partum period. I cannot recommend Bethany's services enough!
