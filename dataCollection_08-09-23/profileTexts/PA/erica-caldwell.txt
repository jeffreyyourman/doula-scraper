Nataliya5/8/2023Erica Caldwell was my doula during my first pregnancy. She supported me in numerous ways prior to me going into labor as well as during and after. Erica provided me with resources and emotional support to help guide me on what type of labor experience I wanted to have as well as how to prepare if it went differently. She was extremely helpful during labor by helping encourage me with proper breathing, positioning and emotional support. She also checked up on me after delivery and it made such a huge difference. I could not thank her enough she was amazing!
