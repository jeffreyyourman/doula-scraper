Autumn Liao7/6/2022We had a good experience with Brook as our birth doula even though we were her first client. She was well educated and a big comfort to my husband and I in the delivery room. She made sure that I was comfortable and have everything I needed. Even after our daughter Stella was born, Brook continue to reach out to us and answering my questions as a new mom. I would definitely highly recommend her to anyone who's expecting a baby!Â
