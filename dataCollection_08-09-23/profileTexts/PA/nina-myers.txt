Lauren5/19/2023We had the priviledge of working with Nina over the past few months while we needed night shift help.Nina was always punctual, she was helpful around the house and instantly put me at ease. She never seemed flustered with the baby - even if our daughter was up ALL night. Knowing that our baby was being cared for by someone I could trust, meant that I could catch up on rest and recover sooner. She was a godsend and I honestly would't ever do this again with out her help. I highly recommend her services and have passed her information on to many of my mom friends.
