Sydney Brooks7/20/2023We had the pleasure of getting to work with Michelle after our original doula was unable to attend our birth. It was such a blessing in disguise! Michelle is kind, compassionate, and extremely knowledgeable. She stepped up tremendously during our unmedicated hospital birth and helped me stay true to my birth plan. Even my OB/GYN later commented on how Michelle is one of the better doulas one of his patients has brought into their birth. We are so thankful to have gotten to meet Michelle and so appreciative of her help in welcoming our baby girl into the world. You will not be disappointed in choosing Michelle for your birth! 


Meagan brown7/19/2023My experience with Mrs. Michele was absolutely perfect. She was an absolute wonder since the first day I met her. From the way she comforted my other children, down to all the knowledge and offered assistance before and after my birth was spot on. I couldn't of asked for a better hands on, patient, sweet, heart warming person to make my natural birth any more perfect. I'm so grateful that I got to have her in my presence during these important/exciting moments! Thank you so much!
