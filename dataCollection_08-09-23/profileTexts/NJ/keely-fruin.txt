Noelle7/19/2023Keely was an amazing supportive presence during the birth of our son. After a traumatic first birth that ended in a C section, a vbac was a huge goal for me in the birth of our second child and I’m not sure it would have been possible without Keely’s support. From giving me positions to do leading up to the birth to turn my posterior baby to doing counter pressure and massage during every contraction of my labor, Keely’s support was invaluable. My husband loved having Keely there to give him guidance on how to best support me and encourage us to try different labor positions. At one intense moment of the birth, Keely had to run out to get a nurse, which allowed my husband to stay in the room holding my hand and encouraging me. I would highly recommend her as a wonderful birth doula to anyone looking for support in your birth experience!!!
