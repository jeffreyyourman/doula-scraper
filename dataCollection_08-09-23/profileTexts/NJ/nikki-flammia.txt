Jeffrey Forero5/16/2021Where do I begin, I can't say enough great things about Nikki... Not only was she a pleasure to work with but she was extremely professional... she put use at ease when we hit a couple of bumps. She was really knowledgeable. If we ever have another child we will surely hire her! 


Amber Murray3/10/2021I had a great experience with Nicole.  She is truly amazing from beginning to end,  she made me feel so comfortable during this process while in delivery.  I was nervous at first but she made me feel very at ease. She was  a true blessing and I'm so glad i was able to have her as my Doula.  


Heather Harris12/9/2019Nikki was absolutely amazing. Before delivery she was available to answer any questions no matter what time of day and made me feel like I was her top priority. She always made me feel like my questions were valid and she was honest with her answers even if she had to get more information herself.  Every meeting with her I felt like she was all in and so excited and ready to be there in any way I needed. The day of delivery she was fantastic. She met us at the hospital right away and I felt like her focus the entire time. She tried different techniques to make me comfortable and was open and understanding if it wasn't for me and ready to try something else. She was great when I said how I felt and made sure the doctors and nurses knew what was going on so I didn't have to. She allowed my husband and me to focus on being comfortable and she made sure I stayed hydrated and on track for what I wanted with birth. The day of delivery we already decided we would be using Nikki again for our future births. Thank you Nikki for all you did to make this the way we wanted and for checking in afterwards too.
