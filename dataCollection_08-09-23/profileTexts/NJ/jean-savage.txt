Kelly O’Leary6/30/2020Having Jean's support at the birth of my daughter and throughout my pregnancy was one of the best decisions I could have made during my journey to motherhood! Jean is extremely compassionate, professional and supportive!! As first time parents my husband and I had no idea what we were getting into when the labor process began.  Jean provided the most amazing support and guidance as my labor quickly progressed and I was in the most pain of my life. She was there to support both me and my husband in ways we didn’t know we would need! From helping me get through each contraction physically and mentally (through massage, aromatherapy, empowering me with encouraging words, and literally holding me up through the pain) to helping my husband participate and giving him ways to support me when he was overwhelmed.  I 100% recommend Jean as a doula to any birthing person wanting a calming and loving support in their time of labor! She is the best of the best and truly cares about her clients!!
