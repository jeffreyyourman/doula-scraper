Paula Brudnicki7/6/2023My husband and I chose Christine to be our doula for our second pregnancy, after not having one for our first. Though grateful for a healthy pregnancy and baby, my first delivery left me longing for something different. My delivery felt impersonal and left me feeling disconnected from my baby. This time around I was determined to avoid induction, if possible… I wanted to take a more natural route, and really feel. This time, after another unplanned induction, I went into the delivery room with little expectation… but I left so. very. full. Throughout my entire pregnancy, Christine was such an encouraging and knowledgeable support. She made herself available to answer all my questions, putting my worries to rest. Christine helped me establish and carry out a vision for my birth. Her warm personality and deep understanding made it so easy to trust her, and ultimately, trust myself. Christine helped me establish and carry out a vision for my daughter’s birth. Though an induction was not my hope, thanks to her, birthing my daughter was a far better experience than I could’ve hoped. During the most challenging parts of my delivery, It was a relief to have her in my corner. She was ready to suggest alternative birthing positions that kept me comfortable, and continually encouraged me to trust my body. I had a joyful delivery that was even speedier than expected. (In fact, the doctor barely made it in time). Together, we welcomed my gorgeous girl, Eden- 7 lbs. 3 oz. Now I feel incredibly proud and empowered and am beyond excited for our next baby, whenever he or she may come.
