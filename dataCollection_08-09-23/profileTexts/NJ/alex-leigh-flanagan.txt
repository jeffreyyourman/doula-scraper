Kim Zuccarello10/7/2020Alex was our doula for our first pregnancy/child. We met with her when I was in my second trimester and knew right away that she would be our doula; we immediately felt comfortable, listened to and supported in what we wanted for our birth experience. The entire pregnancy she was an amazing support system. She checked in on us consistently, provided so much knowledge and resources and helped keep me at ease. I wanted to have as natural a birth as possible and without Alex I don’t think I would have had one.She steered me in the right directions for what I wanted and she was willing to learn about different methods of birthing to fit my wishes. Even though my pregnancy was during the pandemic, she was always available virtually and it didn’t end up making a big difference. When the big day came, thankfully the hospital did allow her to be there in the room with us. She and my husband helped keep me calm and focused on what I had learned through my research and birthing classes. She offered great suggestions during labor as well such as different positions to try and counter pressure massages. I truly believe I could not have done it without her. She was an excellent support for me but also for my husband. Since we wanted a natural birth in a hospital he was so glad to have someone else there to ensure our birth plan was respected. She also supported us postpartum and still does!We highly recommend Alex to anyone who would like to see their dream birth experience realized. Whenever we’re ready for our next baby we already know we want her to be a part of it.
