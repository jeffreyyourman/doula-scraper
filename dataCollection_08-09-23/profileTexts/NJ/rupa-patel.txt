Erik11/8/2022Rupa is an amazing doula. She was very informative and supportive throughout my entire care. When I first met Rupa you could tell she was passionate about what she does and genuinely invested in supporting us. We were so comfortable having her by our side. She was always available to reach for any questions or concerns that we had. Rupa provided us with amazing resources and was very informative so we could make informed decisions.  Rupa is so kind and amazing to work with and if the time comes for baby number two she will be by our sides again. 


Alexandra Reyes11/2/2022Rupa was amazing to work with. This was my first pregnancy so I had many questions. She was always quick to respond and provided great resources. Rupa is knowledgeable and confident, I appreciated those qualities about her. Her energy is grounded and calming, exactly what you need in your birthing space. I look forward to working with her again!
