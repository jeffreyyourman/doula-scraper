Viktoriya Vayner7/27/2023Marianne was my Doula for the birth of my son in April. It was wonderful to have someone experienced in childbirth to be there with me and help with any questions, help me with my fears, and help me stick with my birth plan to not an epidural. She was a knowledgeable and calming presence and made me feel very comfortable and safe. Her process before labor and childbirth allowed me to prepare for childbirth and take all measures to be ready, think about my options, be organized, and go to the hospital feeling confident.


Alessia Wisniewski7/26/2023Marianne was my doula for my second birth. My pregnancy did not go as hoped and I developed preeclampsia in my third trimester. After deciding to work with Marianne she supported me every step of the way. Answering calls and text messages quickly for the remainder of my pregnancy, providing me with some herbs, giving me advice on how to feel comfortable in the last few weeks, etc. I unexpectedly had to give birth due to the preeclampsia worsening. I was 5 weeks early and terrified. Marianne came to my side at the hospital immediately. She was with my the entire way, and when it was decided I need a C-section for the health of me and my baby she was supportive and provided me the comfort I needed in a scary situation. Marianne checked in on me multiple times after birth and we still keep in touch four months later and I hope to continue to keep in touch with her! She is the best doula you can ask for. She provides comfort, strength, and a maternal presence that you will love during your labor and birth process.
