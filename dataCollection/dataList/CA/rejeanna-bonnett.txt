Elaine7/28/2023Rejeanna was our birth doula. I was in labor on Christmas night and she came right to the hospital. She made me feel very comfortable and I appreciated how she helped keep me calm, despite the complications I had. As this was our first baby, my husband and I appreciated having her there with us for the birth, since it was a new and stressful experience and she helped reassure us through the process. I highly recommend Rejeanna for doula support! 


Brooke Deering12/15/2022Rejeanna was wonderful throughout my pregnancy and birth! She was very attentive and answered all my questions. During the birth she was very supportive to me and my husband, with her encouraging words and even though it was virtual we felt her calming presence.
