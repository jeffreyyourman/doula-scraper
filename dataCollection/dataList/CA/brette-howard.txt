Pier Iberti8/26/2022Doula Brette was phenomenal to work with and I can't imagine the experience without her. My husband and I appreciated how patient she was with every question we had. She was beyond prepared, knowledgeable and most importantly kind and calm. She walked us through every step as we approached birth and was available to talk through all my concerns and fears. When I went into labor she was a superstar- the TENS unit and other goodies she brought were so valuable in helping me find relief when contractions became intense. When we arrived at the hospital she was already waiting outside with a wheel chair and did I mention she massaged my hips and back for 8 hours!!!!! She was also a great advocate and made sure our wishes were respected during the labor process at the hospital. We cannot imagine the experience without her and we feel that she is now an extension of our family. Thank you Brette, we couldn't have done it without you!
