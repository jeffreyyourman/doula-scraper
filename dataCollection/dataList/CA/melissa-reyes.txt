Judit Zádor2/7/2018I don't know what I would have done without Melissa! She was with us during the entire delivery, but of course her help started way before then in the form of pre-birth consultation. We called her when my contractions were strong enough, late in the evening, and she was there for me, and for us, for almost 24 hours, with seemingly infinite energy. My delivery was not easy, but I felt safe the whole time. She has a calming presence, which both guided me according to my birth plan, at the same time she created the mental space to accept that I ended up having a C-section despite all my efforts and plans. She helped me feel happiness instead of something else when I finally held my baby in my hands. As a bonus, during one of her postpartum visits she managed to massage away my persistent, nursing-related backache. Melissa is a treasure!
