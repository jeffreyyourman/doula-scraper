Kelly Kilman7/12/2023There is no way I would have been able to stick to my birth plan without Isabel. Our prenatal meetings with her were helpful to visualize my goals during birth and she gave me the tools to use to meet those goals. Isabel helped me prep my body and mind for the labor process by giving me tips and routines to stick to during pregnancy.During labor, she guided and assisted myself and my husband. She helped me work through my contractions by using the counterpressure positions we talked about in our prenatal meetings.She always made sure my husband was included during labor and really helped support him while he supported me.Isabel made sure to check up on me after birth. During our postpartum visit she prepared me for what would come in the weeks ahead.When I think of my birth story, it always feels so magical, like everything I wished for came true and I know that wouldn't have been possible without her.
