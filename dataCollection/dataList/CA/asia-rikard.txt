Kaleb Valdez8/21/2018I have worked closely with Asia for many years and in some very high-intensity, high-performing situations. While I may not have hired her as my doula on account of not being pregnant (because I'm a male) I can definitely recommend her on a professional level. Asia is a very positive and confident person, an intuitive listener, and a selfless caregiver. She is very knowledgeable and is able to deliver quality care and anticipate your needs. She is the type of person I refer my expecting patients to, and the right one for the job of helping you welcome your newest one into the world.I recommend Asia without any reservation or hesitation to anyone in the greater Austin area looking for a competent and confidence-instilling doula!
