Stephanie Landrum-Hall4/5/2023When searching for a full spectrum doula, it was important to my husband and I that we select someone who would serve as a guide leading up to and during labor, have ample knowledge of the childbirth process, and be readily available to support us during our baby’s birth. Amber brought all of these qualities and more to our childbirth experience.Upon meeting Amber, we instantly felt at ease and knew that we aligned well with her practice. Amber comes with a wealth of knowledge and helped us mentally and emotionally prepare for the birth of our baby girl. As first-time parents, we had a multitude of questions about the birth process, and she helped ease our anxiety by providing resources and recommendations.She readily made herself available to us leading up to our due date, clearing her schedule in anticipation of the big day… which was fortunate given that our baby girl decided to come 9 days early. Amber was present throughout labor, providing massages, cold compresses and consult.We are grateful to have worked with Amber, and would recommend her to those looking for a compassionate and skilled full spectrum doula.


Heather Lanctot2/6/2023We were so honored to have Amber as our postpartum doula. She not only provided us with resources and support in the form of meal prep, help with changing out/organizing baby clothes, working with swaddles etc., she was also a wonderful companion for me (as a first-time mom) and a calming presence in our home. We would recommend Amber to any other parents who have recently welcomed a new member into their family. She is wonderful!
