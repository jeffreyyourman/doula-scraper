Lindzey1/19/2021Working with Michelle was an absolute pleasure! She was easy to communicate with, very informative, extremely professional and made the whole process feel very easy and natural. I was worried about inviting a stranger into such an intimate part of our lives but she made it easy, like she had been a friend of ours forever. I highly recommend her services to anyone who is looking for a doula or an extra support person during such a crazy part of your life.Â
