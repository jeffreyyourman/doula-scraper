Austin salmen2/8/2023Where to start. Sarah was our doula for our first baby. She was beyond loving and supportive. We experienced a few intimidating moments in the hospital and Sarah stood by us, supported us, advocated for us, prayed over us, she even texted and updated my family the entire time so that we didn't have to. In the hard moments she grounded us and reminded us of our grace. In the easier moments she motivated us to work through it and rest when necessary. We had a 33 hour labor (from when my water broke) and she walked us through every single minute of it. And that was just the active labor. Coming into labor Sarah provided us with consultations, two prenatal appointments, and her full availability for calls and questions when we were feeling uncertain or needed some affirming. She was our saving grace during a physically, mentally, and emotionally taxing labor. From my very first question about what a doula is to pushing our baby out to helping us latch for the first time, Sarah showed us so much love and transparency through every step. We absolutely loved having her with us. She is a empowering person to have as a doula. We love you Sarah thank you for creating such a beautiful experience for usÂ love,austin, shanna, and baby alice
