Ariana Buccat7/25/2023Ke’xia was an instrumental part of my care team during and after my pregnancy. I was immediately drawn to her gentle and laid-back spirit, two qualities that helped ease my anxiety as a first-time mom. She was always prompt to offer support, and she made both myself and my partner feel much more confident in anticipation of baby’s arrival. Ke'xia was the first person I texted as soon as I went into labor; despite it being 3am, she immediately responded and walked me through what the next few hours would be like, how to time my contractions, and when I should go to the hospital.Although she couldn’t physically attend the birth and sent a backup doula in her place (who was also incredible), I genuinely believe Ke’xia’s guidance empowered me to advocate for myself and my baby and have the birth story of my dreams: a vaginal, unmedicated birth (with the baby delivered in a squatting position, no less!). Even though she was technically just my birth doula, she continued to offer postpartum support over the next few weeks that was integral to my healing. I am forever grateful to Ke’xia and her affirming energy and will no doubt reach out to her again for any future pregnancies!
