Tiffany4/14/2023I had a planned C-Section.  I appreciate Monique's prescence.  I was alone.  Monique met me at the hospital on time for my appointment.  I have a fear of needles and cannot stand the sight of blood.  I started getting anxiety when the nurse came in to draw blood.  Monique put a cold towel on my head and started talking to me about my favorite band.  She kept so distracted with laughter I barley felt the nurse's pinch.  Monique kept me engaged I didn't even look to see the viles of blood drawn.  She was a great support. ....Tiffany
