Akhila Ananth9/12/2014Throughout my very normal pregnancy and slightly complicated delivery, Julia was my rock! When i had a question or concern, she answered it in minutes. When I faced choices with my doctor, Julia was there to explain what each meant and what her experience was with the options. But it was when I was in labor that I understood why doulas are so important to giving birth today, especially if you are giving birth in a hospital. Julia was by my and my partner's side through the whole process, supporting both of us and giving me the faith to deliver our baby. She was in tune with us throughout--she knew when to let us make our decisions and when to step in and take over when we felt lost in the medical model and needed the support. I 100% credit our successful delivery to having her by our side at every crucial moment!! And, I feel like I also gained a friend. Aside from being an incredible resource on all things pregnancy- and birth-related (and an AMAZING masseuse!!!), Julia is warm, caring, and so easy to get along with. I can not recommend her services enough!!
