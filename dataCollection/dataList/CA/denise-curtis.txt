Kristina2/10/2022Denise was my postpartum doula and was such a joy to have with my newborn for the first 4 weeks.  As a first time mother, I was extremely nervous about my postpartum care and how to take care of an infant.  Denise was so helpful on things we should do, products we might like, and general questions we had around sleeping, breastfeeding, and feeding the baby.  I appreciated her weekly check-in's pre-baby and overall organization.  She was a welcome relief in the morning after long nights with the baby.  I can't recommend her enough!
