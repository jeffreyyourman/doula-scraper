Faith Moody8/4/2023Haley was such a great doula. For my birth plan I wanted things a certain way and she made sure to meet everyone of those needs! For example I didn't want my baby to have certain shots. I get nervous and   just forget my plans with doctors sometimes and don't speak up. But Haley was there to be a voice for me and put her foot down to the doctors about things I wanted. She was also such a calming presence when I got my epidural(and that hurt lol), and I felt relaxed!! She also took amazing pictures of my baby that I am in love with!she is great prices that you really can't find anywhere and  I am so happy that we went with her. She will be there for the next birth!
