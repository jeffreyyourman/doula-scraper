Faviola Oseguera3/7/2021I was able to reach out to Ruth during my first trimester of my pregnancy. I was in bed rest due to subchorionic hematoma. And I wanted to have a doula at my side. When I was 35 weeks my water broke and Ruth was able to take me to the hospital it was a participant during my emergency cesarean. Unfortunately, I had to leave behind my baby due to under developed lungs. After a long 16 days in the NICU, I was finally able to bring him home. I am very happy that Ruth was there to help me throughout my pregnancy delivery and post pregnancy. She was there to motivate me and to not give up on breast-feeding. I am highly satisfied with her.


Monica Sanchez3/5/2021Ruth is a very caring and loving individual. She helped me with my first child. I delivered at forty weeks. It was a very long labor. She really helped me stay calm and made the environment relaxing and peaceful. Childbirth is not an easy thing and to have someone who truly cares and has such a calm demeanor by your side truly helps. I am very grateful to have had her by my side. I highly recommend her.
