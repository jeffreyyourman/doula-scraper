Yvette3/8/2022Miss Micaiah!Having her as a doula completely saved me in my first few months postpartum. My son, Ezekiel and I were in such transitioning times and I searched for support because I needed a pair of hands other than family to support my decisions on how to raise my son.Micaiah not only supported and exceled in how she connected with my son but was extremely important in my emotional rollercoaster.She was so hands on, if she wasn't helping me with laundry she was helping me feed and put Ezekiel to sleep. When she wasn't doing either of those she was checking in on how my body was recuperating. I was so blessed by her, she loves working with the body so I was able to enjoy a body massage as the pain of my epidural was constantly bothering my back.Throughout our time we developed a beautiful connection, the best part was finding a friend in Micaiah. We shared so much with each other and resonated with our mindsets so much. Witnessing the interaction so pure and full of love with my son gave me so much peace, I wish she could be with us always! Being a single mother is very difficult but Micaiah gave me the support and encouragement to believe in myself.I am extremely and forever grateful for her helping me maneuver these hard times. Any one who chooses Micaiah will not regret it!!
