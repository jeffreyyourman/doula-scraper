Olivia12/9/2022I cannot recommend Abby enough! She is kind, calm, easy to talk to, compassionate and has the most peaceful demeanor in the birth space. She was my doula for my first baby and I cannot imagine the experience without her. She is incredibly knowledgeable and will advocate for and support any kind of birth journey. She has the best resources and the most helpful advice (with the perfect sense of humor mixed in!). I always appreciated that I could ask her anything and never feel judged or rushed, only gently reminded to follow my own intuition. Her guidance throughout pregnancy and birth is absolutely priceless. Abby is WONDERFUL in every way, and I feel so lucky to have met her when I did.


Audrey Anderson12/7/2022If you are thinking of hiring Abby as a   Doula, do it! I had a wonderful birth experience and a huge part of that was having Abby's presence in the room. She is the only person who stayed awake and was there for anything I needed. Abby is extremely comforting, soothing, and supportive. Her presence alone changed the atmosphere of the room and I always felt like I was in good hands. I asked her question after question, I dug my nails into her  hand during pushing, and asked her to check if I pooped multiple times. Abby was always happy to do anything I needed, including playing music when things got difficult, flipping me over from side to side, and encouraging me through pushing. When I was in pain, Abby rubbed my back and always made sure I was comfortable and had everything I needed. This twas my first baby and I am truly grateful I got to have Abby there for the birth of my son.
