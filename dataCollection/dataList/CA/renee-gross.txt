Brittney Adams8/5/2023Renee was the support we needed for our first birth! She always had an upbeat friendly demeanor! She catered to our learning style to help us understand pros and cons of important birth decisions. She helped me with pain management techniques and gave my husband ways he could help me with birth support/ pain managment, as well. Having her at our birth made us feel confident that we were doing everything right. She even helped us get our babies head un-stuck so we could continue the natural birth that we wanted.  Throughout my birth I felt in control, heard and taken care of. We met up after and discussed the entire birth.  It was a nice time to reflect.  She checked on our well being and gave us resources to make sure our postpartum time went smoothly.  We were very fortunate to have Renee as our doula!
