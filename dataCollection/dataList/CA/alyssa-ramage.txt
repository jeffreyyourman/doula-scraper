Sarah4/14/2023My husband was nervous to hire a doula but we were both so glad we hired Alyssa! She knew exactly what we needed without even asking and helped both my husband feel comfortable confident and myself empowered that I could do it. Alyssa helped guide me into different positions so help labor progress and then when things got tough she was there to hold my hand and reminded me of my little girl we were about to meet. Couldn't have given birth without her! We then also hired her for postpartum support and yet again she knew exactly what to do often without asking. She even help feed me while I was feeding the baby. Thank you Alyssa!!!
