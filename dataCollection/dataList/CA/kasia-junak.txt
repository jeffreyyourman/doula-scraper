Justyna5/30/2023I had a pleasure meeting Kasia in 2022 when I was pregnant. She was with me my entire pregnancy and pospartum time. Kasia is full of compassion and love person. During my labor, she was all the time supporting me emotionally and physically. I felt really comfortable with her being around me during labor. As a first time mom I really appreciate her help not only during childbirth but also being with me during pospartum. I am so happy to have her as a doula and as a friend.
