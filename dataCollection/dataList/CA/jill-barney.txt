Jordan Nevarez6/22/2022I wasn't the one giving birth, my girlfriend was, but I just wanted to say that for my own sanity, having Jill there was lifesaving. She helped relax me too! She was not only supportive for my girlfriend, but she also was for me. She is an amazing birth doula and I highly reccomend her to anyone searching for one worthwhile. She is awesome!Â 


Loreyna Versosa6/22/2022Jill is the best birth doula... ever. I don't know what I would've done without her supporting me, advocating for me, and calming me through my birth experience. She is the definition of a down to Earth person who truly loves what she does. She is passionate about her work and building relationships with her clients and establishing a foundation to make for the birth experience YOU want. Not to mention her communication is top notch. When she says she's there for you, she really means it and it shows through her actions! You don't find many people like that nowadays. My birth went exactly how I wanted it to BECAUSE of her. Anyone would be lucky to have her and I recommend her to all my preggo friends! Everyone could use a Jill in their life and during labor ??
