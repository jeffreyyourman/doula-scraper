Melissa kowalczyk2/7/2023I hired Megan for my Third burth/first home-birth. I didn't realize how impactful her role would be until she came the night I went into labor. 12am January 24th she came and never left my side. She jumped right in and took control of my needs and never once made me feel anything but comforted and cared for. She was made to for the role of being your doula! I knew right away that she was who I wanted to work with. She stayed with me through every contraction and was very hands on, she knew exactly what I needed in every moment, at times I didn't know what I needed and her being there she took that stress from me completely. What an amazing experience I had and I couldn't have done it without Megan by my side!!!Â 


Carrie Hess-Marcoux10/15/2022I hired Megan for the birth of my first child and had an amazing experience with her even though my birth itself did not go as planned. Leading up to the birth, Megan was highly knowledgeable about birth and the labor process. She had tons of fun "tools" such as a birth ball, affirmation cards, a mirror etc. that I could use during labor and not have to worry about finding them or bringing them myself. She was great about checking in and making sure she knew what I hoped for in my birth regarding a "birth plan". We connected on similar philosophies and fascination with the natural birth process and the amazing capabilities of the human body. I ended up having an unexpected c-section at the last minute and Megan came to the hospital and spent time with us in recovery and was there for us despite things not going as to plan. Megan is someone I trusted and would recommend!
