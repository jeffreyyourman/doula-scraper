Caitlin3/8/2023Highly recommend Shelby! She helped me deliver my 2020 baby and with recovery after! My labor, delivery, and recovery was 100x smoother and less anxiety with her by my side! She made sure my birth plan was followed and everything went as planned! She respected me and my wishes. She also gave my baby her first bath exactly how I had wanted! She is the sweetest woman ever! So thankful to have had her by my side.Â
