Lisa B.3/28/2023The Christian Doula LLC is definitely a “one-stop shop” if you are looking for a full-spectrum doula who loves the work. Our daughter has benefited so much from having Chelsea in our lives during her entire first year. Whenever we need Chelsea for infant care, overnight care, or meal prep assistance, she always finds time for our family. Chelsea was pregnant herself and still caring for my family and bonding with my daughter! My daughter is Completely attached to Chelsea and she is now embedded into our family for life. Lisa B.

Chris J.3/28/2023We were fortunate enough to have the owner of The Christian Doula Expc. Chelsea White as our Lead Doula. Chelsea has worked with my family rendering postpartum services for us with both of our children. Chelsea always kept a professional manner around our home and had a warm persona that blends right into our family dynamic. Chelsea offered newborn education that was easy to understand and implement to make for a confident approach by us with our children. Chelsea is an experienced lactation specialist and has helped tremendously during the breastfeeding journey’s of both my kids. Chelsea has an amazing list of resources for both Connecticut and New York that my family had the chance to utilize with other providers who also provide amazing service in their respective fields.. I personally recommend Chelsea’s services to every expectant mama I know in good faith and confidence. We love The Christian Doula Expc.Chris J. Stamford, CT
