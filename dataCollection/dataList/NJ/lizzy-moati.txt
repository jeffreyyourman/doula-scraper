Shanira Carter7/11/2023She’s the absolute best! Very nurturing, and informative. She made me feel so comfortable. With the knowledge that she has. I would highly recommend her. She knows what she’s doing, and she truly does care.


Amanda Valente7/11/2023Working with Lizzy was a fabulous experience. Lizzy immediately helped me and my husband feel comfortable with allowing her to be part of the intimate experience of the birth of our second child. We met in person to discuss my desires for my unmedicated birth and while my due date approached, Lizzy was always on call to answer questions or just to check in to see how I was feeling. I don’t think I would have been able to make it through my long labor without pain meds if it wasn’t for Lizzy. She encouraged me to try different tactics to reduce the pain and discomfort.Lizzy truly cares about her clients and goes above and beyond to assist in any way. I highly recommend Lizzy if you are in search of a supportive, compassionate and knowledgeable doula!


Melanie Valente7/11/2023Lizzy was so supportive and comforting during labor. I couldn’t have done it without her. She has a very calming presence which makes all the difference when you’re bringing a new life into the world. She was also very helpful after labor and helping to relax. She consistently checked in on my during pregnancy to offer her support and to see how I was doing. Can’t thank you enough, Lizzy.
