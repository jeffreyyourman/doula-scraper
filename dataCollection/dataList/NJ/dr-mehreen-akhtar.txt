Judelkiss Todd3/21/2022Dr. Mehreen was such an aide during my pregnancy and leading up to birth. Her credentials as both a doctor of physical therapy and a doula shined through her work. I feel like I got the best care. I had my second child during COVID and Mehreen expertise not only quieted my anxious concerns but were such a help in preparation for birth. Her recommendations included exercises, nutrition and mindset that carried me through the birth (she wasn't physically present due to COVID restrictions) but always available by phone. She's knowledgeable, caring and willing to go the extra mile. She's first on my call list if I have another baby.Â
