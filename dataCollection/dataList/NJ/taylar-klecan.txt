Makenzie1/28/2023Taylar is so knowledgeable about all things motherhood! Being a first time mom and not knowing literally anything, Taylar really helped me feel more prepared for baby to come. She explained everything about the actual labor process, my options, what to expect, empowerment etc. And she answered any questions my partner and I had along the way. She has helped me so much not only while I was pregnant but also postpartum with tips for breastfeeding and always there with answers to the tons of newborn questions I have. I honestly am so lucky to have her during this journey and she truly wants the best for every single mom, baby & their family.
