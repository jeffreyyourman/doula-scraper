Emily Eriksson3/8/2023I could not have imagined any better support than what Nikole gave both during my pregnancy and during the birth of my daughter! Not only to me but also to my husband! She helped us to know what to expect and prepare us so we could make conscious decisions regarding the birth. The birth was a real team work and I know that was because of Nikoleâ€™s presence and ability to see my needs and help me to communicate them. Nikole is kindness and ability to listen is outstanding!


Michael Rosa3/8/2023Nicole was simply outstanding. Her support and planning during the pregnancy were key to our successful birth experience. We discussed all the options together and armed with that knowledge, we were able to make decisions during labor that were without a question key in achieving our goal to have a natural birth without the need of an epidural.


Fayth Brand12/16/2022I am so thankful for the guidance and support that Nikole provided throughout my pregnancy and during my delivery. Nikole met with my husband and I throughout my pregnancy to discuss birth plans and we developed a meaningful relationship that allowed us to feel comfortable with her support during delivery. As someone who struggled with the medical bias inherent in a hospital delivery, Nikole helped me to feel more understood and validated in my desire for a more natural approach. I am so happy that when I think back to the birth of my daughter, Nikole is a part of those memories.
