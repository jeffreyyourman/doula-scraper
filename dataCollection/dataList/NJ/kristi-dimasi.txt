Caroline6/16/2023Kristi has been nothing but wonderful in helping me in my breastfeeding journey. As a first time mom, it is very overwhelming with the amount of information online (what to do, what not to do etc.). Kristi has been kind and compassionate and brings a sense of calmness when I have self doubt. She is very professional, knowledgeable and caters to you and your baby's needs. She is also very responsive - just a text or phone call away. Whether it be for breastfeeding counseling or her Doula services, Kristi provides you with an incredible support system and will leave you feeling confident and empowered! I can't recommend her enough!!


Amanda1/18/2023Kristi is a lifesaver! When my daughter was born I was having latch issues and struggling with painful nursing sessions. After speaking to her about it she drove almost an hour to my house the very next day. She truly cares for people and loves what she does. She made me feel extremely comfortable the whole time and gave me a lot of helpful tips to make breastfeeding pain free. I highly recommend hiring Kristi for all of your labor and postpartum needs!
