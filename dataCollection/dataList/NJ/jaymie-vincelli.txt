Springteshya Bieniasz4/24/2023We cannot express how much we appreciate Jaymie being our doula for my pregnancy and delivery in 2022! I have 2 older children who were born via c-section and I didn’t want that experience again. Together with my OBGYN, Jaymie completely supported me throughout my pregnancy for a VBAC2. My son ended up being 2 weeks late and I went in for an induction. During my induction and labor I had 3 different Dr’s and subsequently 3 different shift changes of staff, each with their own pros and cons. Jaymie, however, was our constant. She stayed with us the whole time, leaving only when she sensed we might like a moment just my partner and I. The entire time, she had in mind what I had said I wanted for my birth plan and helped me stick to that plan as much as possible, while kindly reminding me to be flexible as my baby’s birth unfolded. She has such a calming energy. She and my partner were the ultimate support system! Jaymie even caught the hospital staff before they administered something I am allergic to. She worked flawlessly between us and the hospital staff and I think they were grateful for her presence also. Without going into the details of my birth story, I was able to achieve my VBAC2 and our son was born, healthy and happy! We, and especially I, am so immensely grateful for Jaymie’s kind and gentle energy and support throughout it all. She is such a huge reason I was able to achieve this goal and birth my son without having to have another c-section. Any person or family would be fortunate to have her as part of their support system and I hope to use her as my doula again in the future!With all of our hearts we thank you Jaymie!      ~ Spring, Ian & Renzo (Sunny & Darien too)
