Evon Tarnue6/26/2023We strongly recommend Jasmine for ANYONE looking for a Doula. This was our second pregnancy and we couldn't ask for anyone better - she is calm but in control, knowledgeable but not overbearing, a great listener but not afraid to speak.Even though our birthing experience was not exactly as planned, it was a wonderful experience. Jasmine depth of knowledge about what was possible, made choosing what was right for our family so easy. Jasmine also helped us with our birth plans and informative videos through out the entire pregnancy.Her wealth of experience allows her to tailor the experience based on your personal preferences. We felt secure knowing that whatever our decisions, Jasmine would be our informed guide and caring friend.Don't hesitate to book Jasmine as your Doula - you will be glad you did!
