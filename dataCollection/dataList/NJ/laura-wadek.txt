Liz Shults6/29/2018Laura was my doula for my second birth, a VBAC. She was wonderful! She was generous with her time and knowledge during our prenatal appointmets, and I felt very prepared to go into labor. She was texting back and forth with me as I reached and passed my due date, helping to keep me sane. When I did go into labor, she was ready to join us whenever we felt we needed her. She was prepared, grounded, calm, comforting, and very encouraging when she joined us. I had a 24 hour labor/delivery and she was right by my side for anything I might have needed: sips of coconut water, hand-fanning, counter pressure, a hand to hold, and encouraging words. We DID achieve my dream birth! An unmedicated, natural VBAC. She has since been in touch with me to ensure I have ample support in the post pardum period. Thank you Laura, you have been amazing and I highly recommend you to everyone!


Jazmin Arce Ruiz10/24/2016Laura was wonderful! She set up a few appointments with me before the labor to share lots of helpful information and techniques with me which made me feel very prepared for the birth. As I went into labor, she was by my side coaching me, cheering me on, and gave me great massages which made me feel so comfortable and supported through it all. I couldn't have done it without her!
