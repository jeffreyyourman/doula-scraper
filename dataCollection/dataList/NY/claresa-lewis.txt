Jazz12/30/2022Claresa is a beautiful soul. As my pregnancy and postpartum doula, she took my spiritual and overall health serious. Birthing Plan was thorough, healthy relationship was established, she was also very knowledgeable in best practices for my body postpartum. It is so important to have someone around after you come home so you're not overwhelmed. Claresa was patient with me and gave my baby and I the security we needed at our most sensitive time.Â
