Gabriela11/23/2022Lou supported me with the birth and delivery of my daughter. She was extremely helpful and literally an angel. She checked in on me frequently before and after the birth. Lou provided outstanding support mentally and physically.I had a difficult labor due to having been induced as I had low water and restrictive growth and LouÂ provided assistance every step of the way. My labor lasted 2 days and Lou brought such a calming energy, always keeping me motivated, and although I was in distress mentally and physically, her presence was a breath of fresh air. She taught me breathing techniques as well as exercises that helped induce labor.She encouraged me to make the best decisions for me and my baby and provided me with an in depth explanation of what my options were, advocating for my needs at all times with hospital personnel. I am eternally grateful for having had Lou present during one of the most important moments of my life, she is truly a caring and genuine soul.
