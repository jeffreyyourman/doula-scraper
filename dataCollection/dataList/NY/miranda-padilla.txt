Veronica A3/16/2022I cannot thank Miranda enough for bringing her poise, knowledge, charisma, and guidance to my first pregnancy and childbirth. My goal was to have a natural vaginal birth in a hospital setting and Miranda helped me to learn as much as possible about different scenarios so that my partner and I could feel as empowered as possible going through the whole journey. I was able to deliver a healthy 9.2 pound baby boy naturally thanks to her training on breathing techniques, birth partner support through contractions, and knowing about the whole labor and delivery process! She provides so many great tips which helped me feel so calm, including post partum, and you can tell that she keeps up to date with research and a network for both doula/smidwives and moms. I feel so grateful for Miranda's consistent support and friendship, and I'll always remember her with pride as a member of my birth team. I'd 100% recommend working with her! Every expecting/current mom deserves the sense of relief, empowerment, and joy from having a doula like her.
