Cori5/12/2020I met Jaye by chance when my oldest (now 3) was a newborn and  I needed an overnight doula.  Fast forward to today and Jaye is one of my 3-year-old’s favorite people (not to mention one of mine!).  My younger daughter was born this January and Jaye was my obvious choice for a doula.  The birth was not what I’d envisioned (planned c-section due to placental bleeding in the last couple months, a chunk of bed rest over Christmas and New Years...).  Jaye’s help at the birth and during her postpartum stays with us was invaluable.  Her presence obviously helped us through the time she was there but also helped my partner (husband) and I understand what we needed to do for each other - what to ask for, what to expect, how to ask. We only had a night or two of newborn overnight support, but everything went smoothly after that. It’s not like Jaye came in and told us what to do either.  She just showed us what good support looks like and that was instrumental in helping us get the balance “right” for us moving forward.To this day, Jaye is still present for me with supportive check-ins and substantive ones too.  She is flush with both plain old compassion and with helpful resources for all the stages:  expecting mom, new mom, new baby, new non-birthing parent/partner, and older siblings.  If you want it, Jaye is a fantastic organizer too - and goodness knows a new mom can use help in that department.
