LoLa10/24/2022My experience with Kourtney has been wonderful. At first I wasn't sure if I wanted a doula and I didnt know much about it . Kourtney made sure she explained everything to me . She helped me during my whole pregnancy.Kourtney is kind , understanding ,flexible and she can help with different resources. She really put her all into helping me with my needs. She helped me better communicate with the doctors and nurses when I felt like they were not helping.Â  I do recommend Kourtney to any one having a baby ,she will help with your every need.
