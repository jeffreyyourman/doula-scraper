Shandi Temperato2/21/2023Ashley came over after I had my first baby and brought so much love into our home. She has a great passion for mama, babies, birth, and postpartum care. She is very knowledgeable and is more than willing to help answer any questions you may have. She is very kind, compassionate, passionate, loving, and understanding. She also came over after my second baby was born and filled my home with love again! She has provided so much knowledge throughout my pregnancies. She's answered so many questions and has taught me so much! She is an incredible wife, mama, doula, and friend. She will be able to provide you with wonderful doula services and support. ??


Nicole2/4/2023Ashley did a great job being at my side and coaching me through my delivery. She stayed with us for a little while after delivery, making sure we were ok and helping with anything needed! She checked on our family and dropped off a hot meal within the first 2 weeks of being home. So very kind of her! I am very thankful that we were able to have her with us and confident she will do an amazing job for any future mamas!Â 


Danielle10/23/2022Ashley was such a supportive doula. She met with us before birth to make sure we were comfortable and to go over all the details of our birth plan. When the big day came, she was at the hospital with us for so long! I had a long birth and Ashley was instrumental in getting me through it. She also provided assistance post partem with breastfeeding, and also brought a meal over a few weeks later! She is a wonderful, caring and helpful person!
