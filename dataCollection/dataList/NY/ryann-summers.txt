Rachel8/7/2023Birth is a wildly transformational space. You need your support people to be attentive, reliable, sharply aware - yet also calming, comforting, easy, and warm. This is Ryann. This is the kind of person you want at your birth. Ryann attended the birth of our third son who was born at home. In the weeks leading up to birth, she was easily accessible and gave practical prenatal advice. When labor came, Ryann set up a soothing space and put me at ease. When labor became intense, she helped me ride the waves of each contraction and reminded me where to release tension. Her yoga training was a clear benefit in this. Ryann is extremely well grounded, resourceful, and sensitive in the best possible way. We were very blessed to have her help during labor and birth.
