Camille4/18/2023We had an amazing experience with Briani. She guided me and my husband through my first pregnancy with so much care and knowledge. We had a very difficult, long hospital birth, and Briani was there with us every step of the way to be a sounding board as we worked through our options when it was time to make decisions about how to proceed with our birthing process. She also checked up on us after my birth. I highly recommmend Briani and I can not sing her praises enough!


Kaylah sheppard7/29/2022hello everyone! My experience with briani as my doula was amazing. If i could do it all over again with her help and knowledge i would. I am now 11 days post parturm. So far i am adjusting great into becoming a new mom and i have Briani to thank. She has been here physically, emotionally and has helped me the best way that she can. She is always concerned for the baby over course but also my mental health as well. I very much appreciate that. It really has been satisfying for me and my partner with having her as a doula. She has helped with cleaning, preparing meals for me if i need one, sending out information for support groups and just anything that would be helpful with our journey in becoming new parents. I would definitely recommend her as a doula to anyone who is in need. She is the best and you won't regret it!! Thanks briani for all the support!
