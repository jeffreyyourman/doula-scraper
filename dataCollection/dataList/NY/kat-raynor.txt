Carissa Chambers2/15/2023Working with Kat was amazing. Her warmth and excitement for being with families as they welcome their newest little members is contagious and heartwarming. I had a VERY long labor and Kat's steady, noninvasive, encouraging presence was a total gamechanger. I always felt in charge of my labor, unafraid, and informed. Thanks to her many years of experience, I had access to helpful wisdom whenever I needed input to make a decision. Her back massages were also amazing for pain management! Kat has become more than a doula for us. She's a friend now. If we have more children, we will definitely be calling her for round two!


Frank danko2/15/2023I have to share a little about myself before I share about kat. I was never around babies my whole life until my daughter was born. Being the youngest in the family I was the baby and also being the first of my immediate family to have a baby I was just inexperienced. I am so thankful that I had Kat as a doula! She was so helpful with any questions I had which were a lot. She never made me feel like I was asking a dumb question or asking too much which was comforting. During the birth she was so helpful and reassuring. She made some decision making easier with all the info she had for us. And then after the birth she taught me so many things that I never knew before. We couldn't have asked for a better doula from all the stages pre-natal-post Partum
