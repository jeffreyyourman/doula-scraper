Brooke Miller7/19/2023Teresa assisted us in having our first baby on 5/5/23. We started looking into doulas after multiple friends had poor experiences with hospital births. We wanted to increase our chances of having as physiologic of a birth as possible, and Teresa helped us do that. She was such a huge help and support not only during labor and delivery, but throughout the entire pregnancy. She provided us with so much knowledge and many resources that helped us advocate for the birth we wanted. She was also there for all of our questions and helped us to feel confident in our decision making. She is someone who truly cares about those she serves and is passionate about her work. We are so thankful we hired her and hope to have her around for more births in the future!


Rayna Eidberger5/8/2023My husband and I are grateful we hired Teresa Burnett to be our doula for the birth of our second child. Due to our first birth experience, we felt a doula would help ease our minds and benefit us greatly for our second birth. Teresa did all that and more!! She helped us achieve a VBAC and provided so much encouragement and knowledge throughout our pregnancy and the birth of our bundle of joy.Â  She is absolutely amazing and I would most definitely hire her again for her positive services!!!
