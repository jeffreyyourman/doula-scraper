Meaghan Serres8/4/2023Our experience with Caitlynn was wonderful! She was knowledgeable, kind and thoughtful. Before birth she was quick to provide or create resources based on our interests and needs, in addition to what we talked through in person. We felt very prepared and confident for our birth because of her work running us through scenarios and explaining different labor positions, she went above and beyond leading up to and on the day of the birth (which happened to be her birthday) and we have had one of two postpartum visits so far where we could quickly get so many questions answered on our minds. Having an additional support person was so helpful for my husband as well, knowing that I was never alone and that he could get tips and suggestions in the moment on how to support me.
