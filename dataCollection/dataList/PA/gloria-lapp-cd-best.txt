Danielle8/6/2023There is no word to describe Gloria other than amazing. I truly believe I would not have been able to have a successful VBAC if we did not have her support and guidance. She was such a calming and confident presence for me during labor. The immense amount of support and information she was able to provide was unmeasurable. My husband was able to be much more of an active supporter during my labor because of the education she provided him. I am now such a strong believer that everyone who is pregnant should have a doula.
